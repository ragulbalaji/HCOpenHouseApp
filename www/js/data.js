Much flexibility is given for the programme so that members can effectively use club time as their breather from hectic school life to relax and enjoy exploring new ideas and techniques, which we’re sure members can’t wait to try out. We encourage collaborative work and art trades between members to deepen our ties and experience teamwork. <br>A major event would be the Arts Fest, where your collaborative work with other club members will be exhibited for the school to see, the behind-the-scenes hardwork and fun in working with other artists-to-be your special take-away, on top of the pride of having your work shown. Club outings include going to see the latest exhibitions in town, so that we can all go together to see the things we like and be wowed by those who have gone further than us in our field. <br>It’s a small club where you will have the chance to rub shoulders and make good friends with those who share your unique experience of learning various art forms, be it oil painting, water colour and many more. Entry is determined by both passion and proficiency (prior academic experience is not compulsory!) <br>Make sure to block out your Wednesdays, 3pm-5pm, for a fun time with us!

With these requirements in mind, the Economics Unit provides a rigorous course to equip students with the skills necessary for economics awareness and competence. This course imparts both intellectual as well as citizenship training through a well-planned syllabus to promote understanding of the very processes and issues that affect their lives as citizens and students. In addition, Economics Exco was set up to expose students to a range of enriching experiences such as participation in nation-wide competitions, publication of newsletters and trips to overseas to EU and Universities for Summer Programmes. The greatest reward of this course is a better understanding of how the world works.",

More recently, History students visited the United States on an Integrated Humanities trip and caught a glimpse of what makes the world's remaining superpower tick.
