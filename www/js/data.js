We also have regular star-gazing and participate in astronomy retreats in Malaysia, as well as club outings! <br><br>Think Astronomy is all about Doppler shift, Relativity or Kepler's Laws? Think again! Astronomy is more than just Physics, it's more than looking into the distant night sky or a telescope - it's about looking into the past. It's about looking into the unknown. It's about realizing how the universe works; it's about learning about our very own existence, understanding the mystical theories behind the amazing twinkles that shine proudly in the dark. Not everyone can look through a telescope and feel something for the planet, the binary star, the globular star cluster or the nebula they see; but everyone deserves a chance to marvel at the wonders of the Universe, everyone deserves to share, to enjoy the beauty of Astronomy! <br><br>Join us; you'll find your love in Astronomy! We're a bunch of very different people, yet similar in a way - in our desire to know more about the world around us, in our shared passion for the night sky, for the Milky Way; for the Universe. <br><br>Look up at a star - you're looking into the light from trillions of miles away. <br><br>Want to find out more? Visit our website and be amazed by how we photograph the beauty we see in telescopes into pictures in our Astrophotography gallery. Visit our website to see our a large array of activities!

We are, by all counts, a productive CCA: in addition to weekly wing sessions, debate competitions, a literary publication and a poetry-writing service, we have our annual events – a drama production, an inter-faculty drama competition, the Singapore Youth Festival, a poetry slam, a debate invitationals, a debate camp, a film festival, and an arts outreach camp. <br><br>We do our best to offer our member a time and place to do the things they love together, as well as try new things that other people love. To top it off, we also make sure our members know about the most happening artsy things happening outside of school, for it is a great big world out there beyond our sea of khaki.

These will then be shared and critiqued by members during a review scheduled on the following week.<br><br>HCPhotog is a service-oriented CCA. We cover both major school events, such as the MAF and Combined Sports Meet, and other events such as Orientation, etc. To ensure that coverage of such events is smooth, members will be probably taught on the necessary protocols and technical skills needed. We aim to be able to best equip our members, to serve the school in the best possible way.<br><br>Another initiative by HCPhotog is the Iconography, which was inaugurated in 2015. Iconography is a photography conference organized by HCPhotog, in conjunction with Nikon and Photographic Society of Singapore. It provides a platform for youth photographers in Singapore to interact and learn from the perspectives of one another. <br><br>Overall, HCPhotog is a CCA for anyone who has a passion for photography. We accept anyone with or without any prior experience. We also possess several Canon and Nikon camera bodies that are available for members to borrow for practice purposes or during school events.

We have also catalysed a convenient recycling culture by bringing in commingled recycling bins and an E-Waste bin, and installed water-saving taps that have significantly reduced water wastage in our school. We have also spearheaded the Clean Movement Campaign along with representatives from Council and Faculty Committee, pushing through initiatives such as the inter-class bench cleanliness competition as well as spring cleaning sessions. <br><br>At the student level – We execute a variety of initiatives for students. Most notably, we have the annual Clean and Green Week, where the spirit of the Green Movement is truly manifested in Hwa Chong for a week. This year, we will also be setting up a thrift shop at Inner Plaza, which will sell items donated from students and teachers. Through it, we hope to promote reusing of consumer goods while raising money for Needy Pupil Fund. <br><br>At the societal level – we organise an annual green camp for primary school children, helping the younger ones of our country to become more environmentally conscious. In terms of community involvement, we are part of the Bukit Timah Wildlife Network, which aims to encourage non-littering and appreciation of nature. <br><br>To join us, simply sign yourself up at our booth during Open House and CCA exhibition.

Thus, it hones an individual’s endurance, fitness and wits, guaranteeing an unforgettable learning experience.<br><br>There are 3 weapons in fencing, namely epee, foil and sabre. The three weapons, all with different requirements and attributes, ensure that anyone and everyone can find a weapon group that matches their personalities and strengths. <br><br>Although it may seem like an individual sport, fencing is actually an example of a sport where you compete on your own, but you’re working together as a group to win the match. In team events, individual fencers add up their points to get an overall team score. The team spirit enjoyed by our fencers acts as fuel for the team to perform to their level best. <br><br>If you seek a fruitful sporting journey, fencing may just be the thing for you. It isn’t all about just “poking”, rather, it is a battle of skills and wits between two people. Here at HCFC, we welcome all those interested to try! <br><br>Contact Kevin (93829818) or Jie Ying (83518131) for more details!<br><br>",

In the early years when we had yet to become an official, competitive CCA, we did not have funds nor a coach back then to guide us, and everything was run purely by students.

We train for the annual inter-school competitions held normally in end-March, with Hwa Chong being one of the powerhouses in the sport. A usual training session consists of a warm-up, practicing of moves of our routines on trampolines and a physical training session to build up our muscles. Gymnastics is a rare sport in Singapore and requires time and hard work to nurture the technique needed to perform moves on the trampoline. Through this CCA, members have opportunities to develop both their physical and mental strength, as gymnastics trains one’s core and leg muscles especially, while courage to conquer fears in learning new moves and diligence to train regularly to develop steadiness of performing the routine are character traits that a good gymnast needs to have. Our CCA usually comprises a small batch, so this makes bonding much easier, which is beneficial in creating team cohesion that is useful not only in the sport, but in other aspects of Hwa Chong life like studying and having leisure time.&nbsp;<br><br>Contact Shi Yin&nbsp;or Fionna for more details!<br><br>",

The HCI Shooting Club (HCISC) has clinched numerous awards and titles over the past 30 years during national competitions. We also have an excellent record for producing shooters for the national team, with many of them going on to excel on the international stage. <br><br>Shooting is basically divided into 2 categories: Air Rifle and Air Pistol. During competitions, participants stand at their individual lanes and proceed to fire onto a target; 60 rounds for guys, 40 rounds for girls. The maximum score per shot is 10.9 and the minimum, 0. The sum of the stipulated shots will constitute the competitor’s final score. A team is made up of 4 shooters. <br><br>HCISC aims to develop our mental strength. Our experienced and extremely dedicated coach helps us to discover our true potential. Of course, this comes at a price; a combination of self-discipline and sheer determination. Training sessions are 2 hours each, and range from 2 to 6 times a week. It is this burning desire for improvement that has led to our numerous championship titles. <br><br>The strength of our club, however, is not measured by the number of trophies we have won. Rather, it is the team spirit that is forged through time that defines who we are. Though shooting may seem very much like an individual sport, we cannot emphasize enough on how shooting is a team effort. We pride ourselves on a well-bonded and closely-knitted team, which produces long-lasting friendships.<br><br>It is through such foundations that the HCI Shooting Team has grown to where it stands, and will continue to grow for years to come.

Touch players do not tackle each other as in Contact Rugby, but instead touch their opponents in order to gain control of the ball. (Think about it as a 6-on-6 game of catching but way cooler). On attack, each side is given 6 touches before a changeover and a drop-ball is an immediate changeover. There are several other rules, but it’s easiest to learn the sport by trying it out for yourself! ☺<br><br><span class=\"color_11\">ABOUT US</span><br><br>We are a group of good friends who train hard under our coach, Karen, along with several alumni who come back to help out.

On a good day, you are phenomenal!”<br><br>-Karen<br><br><span class=\"color_11\">FAQs</span><br><br>Is Touch Rugby violent?<br><br>Touch Rugby doesn’t involve any tackling of any sort so there aren't major injuries like dislocations etc. However, we are expected to put our bodies on the line for the team, so expect a healthy amount of scratches! You don't have to be rough, but you do need to be aggressive.<br><br>Do I have to be from a sports background?<br><br>Absolutely not!

A goal is scored when a team completes a pass to a player standing (or more likely running) in the endzone they are attacking. <br><br>Ultimate Frisbee combines speed, grace and powerful hurling with grueling intensity, bound to send that heart racing at an exciting pace! <br><br>Now here’s the interesting part: Ultimate is unique in that it is refereed by the players themselves, even at competitive levels, according to a code of conduct known as “the Spirit of the Game”. This places the responsibility for fair play on the players themselves. In that respect, playing Ultimate is a completely different experience to playing other sports. <br><br>To gear us up for interjc each year, our field trainings mainly focus on two aspects – skills and physical training. We undergo various drills under the guidance of our coach, which enable us to be familiar with our plays and stable with our throws and catches. Like all sports, physical training is essential to help us with our stamina and speed when we are on the field. <br><br>HCUlt is a close-knit team with very good inter and intra-batch relations. If you’re interested keeping fit, trying out a new sport, and getting to know a group of like-minded and passionate individuals, then ultimate is definitely an option to keep in mind.<br><br>",

A rather foreign, and perhaps, intriguing sport, the curiosity of fellow Tchoukers-to-be, stemming from word of mouth or witnessing a match, have left them clambering to try their hand at it; Tchoukball’s popularity continues to climb to date, especially in Singapore as Singapore ranks 2nd in the world at this sport.

Established in 2010, the Hwa Chong Tchoukball team started out as a tiny, yet tight-knit interest group. Taking into account the lack of resources —coach and court alike— our founders’ Tchouk journey was, but of course, a tumultuous one. Nonetheless, their burning passion and brimming commitment brought them well-deserved success. In 2011, barely a year after the team was formed, Hwa Chong emerged as Double Champions in the interschool A-division tournament. Their success, an embodiment of 自强不息, forged a legacy to be remembered. <br><br>Body. Mind.

The ‘A’ Level Music Programme is offered to selected students demonstrating high ability and aptitude in Music and prepares them in Music Listening and Analysis, Music Writing and Music Performance over the course of two years. We advocate a holistic music education which develops discipline, emotional expression and enhances a student’s perception of the world and his/her development as a person. A sound music education should develop creativity through activities such as composition and performance, and analytical skills through application based studies, allowing him/her to use music to make an impact and to inspire.  A person with a deep understanding for one form of art often develops interest and passion for other forms of art. ‘A’ Level Students at Nanyang Girls’ High School will take H2 Music.",

In 2005, students caught a glimpse of life after the fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the Cold War in a trip to Germany and Czech Republic. Last year, students visited the Cold War behemoth, the ex-Soviet Union in a whirlwind tour which took them to Moscow and St. Petersburg. More recently, History students visited the United States on an Integrated Humanities trip and caught a glimpse of what makes the world's remaining superpower tick. This year, we made our way to Vietnam and were marvelled at the strides this communist country has made since the introduction of reforms in the late 1980s and the resilience that Vietnamese people displayed during the Vietnam War. So, what are you waiting for? Get in here for an exciting journey through time and space.",

In each phase, students are exposed to a wide variety of texts, genre exposition, and diverse methodologies.\n\nAdopting a differentiated approach to learning that goes beyond the classroom, the course provides students with opportunities to experience Literature through activities like symposiums, debates, mock conferences, field studies, project work, independent study and drama.  Such activities not only expand students' horizons, but also help them look at issues from a broader perspective, apply knowledge, and contest the arbitrary divisions that separate subjects.",
