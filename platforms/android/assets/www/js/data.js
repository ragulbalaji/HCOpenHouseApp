We also have regular star-gazing and participate in astronomy retreats in Malaysia, as well as club outings! <br><br>Think Astronomy is all about Doppler shift, Relativity or Kepler's Laws? Think again! Astronomy is more than just Physics, it's more than looking into the distant night sky or a telescope - it's about looking into the past. It's about looking into the unknown. It's about realizing how the universe works; it's about learning about our very own existence, understanding the mystical theories behind the amazing twinkles that shine proudly in the dark. Not everyone can look through a telescope and feel something for the planet, the binary star, the globular star cluster or the nebula they see; but everyone deserves a chance to marvel at the wonders of the Universe, everyone deserves to share, to enjoy the beauty of Astronomy! <br><br>Join us; you'll find your love in Astronomy! We're a bunch of very different people, yet similar in a way - in our desire to know more about the world around us, in our shared passion for the night sky, for the Milky Way; for the Universe. <br><br>Look up at a star - you're looking into the light from trillions of miles away. <br><br>Want to find out more? Visit our website and be amazed by how we photograph the beauty we see in telescopes into pictures in our Astrophotography gallery. Visit our website to see our a large array of activities!

We are, by all counts, a productive CCA: in addition to weekly wing sessions, debate competitions, a literary publication and a poetry-writing service, we have our annual events – a drama production, an inter-faculty drama competition, the Singapore Youth Festival, a poetry slam, a debate invitationals, a debate camp, a film festival, and an arts outreach camp. <br><br>We do our best to offer our member a time and place to do the things they love together, as well as try new things that other people love.

In 2005, students caught a glimpse of life after the fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the Cold War in a trip to Germany and Czech Republic. Last year, students visited the Cold War behemoth, the ex-Soviet Union in a whirlwind tour which took them to Moscow and St. Petersburg. More recently, History students visited the United States on an Integrated Humanities trip and caught a glimpse of what makes the world's remaining superpower tick. This year, we made our way to Vietnam and were marvelled at the strides this communist country has made since the introduction of reforms in the late 1980s and the resilience that Vietnamese people displayed during the Vietnam War. So, what are you waiting for? Get in here for an exciting journey through time and space.",

In each phase, students are exposed to a wide variety of texts, genre exposition, and diverse methodologies.\n\nAdopting a differentiated approach to learning that goes beyond the classroom, the course provides students with opportunities to experience Literature through activities like symposiums, debates, mock conferences, field studies, project work, independent study and drama.  Such activities not only expand students' horizons, but also help them look at issues from a broader perspective, apply knowledge, and contest the arbitrary divisions that separate subjects.",
